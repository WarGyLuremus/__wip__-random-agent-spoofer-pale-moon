--Random Agent Spoofer-Pale Moon Edition--

-Background-

Hi all, in the process of switching from Firefox to Pale Moon I found that RAS wasn't compatible with Pale Moon, so I decided to make my own. This is the first time I'll be coding anything, outside of the linux command line and Codecademy, since a Java course I took last year and obviously my first major project. 

I will consider relinquishing ownership of this fork to anyone with more experience/enthusiasm for the project.
